Project Statement: Smart Study Planner
 Problem Statement
Many students and learners struggle with effective study management. They often face challenges such as:

Procrastination due to unclear goals and overwhelming task lists.

Inefficient study sessions resulting from poor prioritization and lack of structure.

Burnout caused by an imbalance between study time and rest.

Inability to track progress effectively, leading to uncertainty about mastery of a subject.

This leads to lower productivity, increased stress, and sub-optimal learning outcomes. The current methods (manual planners, basic to-do apps) lack the intelligent scheduling and analytical feedback necessary for modern, effective learning.

 Project Scope
The Smart Study Planner project will deliver a web and/or mobile application designed to manage the entire study lifecycle, from goal setting to performance review.

In-Scope:
Core Task Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for study tasks and subjects.

Algorithmic Scheduling: Implementation of a scheduling algorithm that considers priority, deadline, estimated duration, and user availability to generate a daily/weekly plan.

Session Tracking: A timer functionality to accurately record time spent on tasks.

Basic Analytics Dashboard: Visualizations for study time distribution and task completion rates.

User Authentication and Profiles.

Out-of-Scope (Future Enhancements):
Integration with external academic calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Canvas).

Collaborative study group features.

Advanced machine learning for predictive performance analysis (e.g., estimating exam scores).

Gamification elements (e.g., rewards, leaderboards).

 Target User
The Smart Study Planner is primarily designed for:

University and College Students: Those managing multiple courses, assignments, and exam preparation schedules.

Self-Learners & Skill Developers: Individuals studying for certifications, learning new programming languages, or pursuing continuous education.

High School Students: Learners who need to establish disciplined study habits early on.

Key User Needs: Structure, clear prioritization, accountability, and performance feedback.

High-Level Features
The application's success will be measured by the implementation and performance of these key features:

Smart Task Prioritization: Allow users to assign a Difficulty score (e.g., 1-5) and a Priority level (High, Medium, Low) to every task, which feeds into the scheduling logic.

Automated Schedule Generation: A primary function that processes all pending tasks and free time to automatically generate an optimized, time-blocked study plan for the day or week.

Study/Break Timer (e.g., Pomodoro): An integrated timer that enforces structured study intervals and mandatory rest breaks to maintain focus and prevent burnout.

Performance Dashboard: A centralized view providing visual summaries of study hours per subject, task completion trends, and time-on-task versus estimated time.

Reusable Templates: Ability to save successful study schedules as templates for recurring courses or exam cycles.
